It is indeed hard to come up with a topic for a blog post that could ease others curiosity or generally be helpful for those reading these lines. But then almost a month has passed, heck next year is within a few days and I haven’t been doing or working on alot of things or stuff that might fill my resume or be….you know….‘productive’.\nThis whole December had passed with me starring at my monitor without any assignments, tasks and even jobs to be completed. So I have decided to occupy myself for the last few days of this year by writing this post.\nGames. Most of us by now know what games are. Whether you are still in your youthful days playing CS:GO and watching gameplay of your favorite let’s play youtuber or being a parent watching over your child playing games and then scolding them that they should be doing their school work and get the first rank. It is of no surprise that games are in fact one of the decorated and innovative creations by the common people.\nWith that being said, I would like to talk about my gaming experiences.\nPlatforms Flash games Those who were born before 2010 might know what flash games are or even those who had access to a personal desktop. I remember playing them during the weekends when me and my brother were done with our school work. I would handle the movement or the WASD keys and other keybinds whereas my brother would focus on using the mouse to shoot (generally shooter games). We played those single player game into a double player coordinated game.\nSome of the flash games that me and my brother played during 2008-2011 together are:\n Strike Force Heroes Raze Plazma Burst Earn to Die  A few years passed by and it was around 2014-2015 I found myself revisiting flash games for nostalgia. There were new released sequels to the above titles I mentioned and other new games that were popular. Some notable one I played were:\n Sift Heads Puffballs United games (before their steam release) Fancy Pants Adventures Stick War  and more….but the most favourite game I had played was Madness: Project Nexus.\nThere are both good and bad news for flash games.\nBad news: In the end of 2020 it was announced that flash would not be supported anymore and thus rendering all flash games in the internet non-playable. It rather made me sad since flash game were the ones which made in interested in games.\nGood news: Some flash games are being remade in other game engines like unity or unreal. Like Strike Force Heroes, check out the reddit link here.\nAnd Madness Combat have their game also released and you can check out their steam page here. Highly recommend playing this.\nI would also like to mention that few well known flash games has really good plot and lore in it like Raze. I had made a youtube video on the entire lore and story of Raze and you can see it here.\nIt is rather sad that we cannot experience the same flash games as we used to before. We could still play those by downloading the respective files and running them in a flash player or a shockwave file player to play them but then something still seems to be missing.\nConsole Now we get to the good part. The first instance of me playing a console game was through my neighbour’s console around 2010. His relative had bought him Xbox 360 with Halo 3: ODST. Little did I know I would deeply embrace Halo and its lore.\nI was more of an Xbox person because of halo but I also played other games like:\n Assassin’s Creed 2 COD: Black Ops 1/2 Skate 1/3  And ofcourse all Halo series for Xbox 360.\nI think I would end this section sooner since all I ever did was play the campaign in Halo over and over and over again. And yeah split screen for the win.\nPC Well this is kinda a fresh topic since I have been playing in my laptop near the start of my college semesters (since Mar 2020). And the worst part is that 3 semesters has passed and its still in online mode giving me alot of free time.\nMy machine can’t handle all those AAA games with 240fps like the cool kids, so I should settle for something less. Here are the games I had played and probably playing in choronlogical order:\n Fortnite Rocket League Genshin Impact SCP: Secret Labatory Brawlhalla Crab Game  I play other few light weighted games and no other full-on intense gaming since I have college work to do.\nMobile And finally mobile gaming…….yeah. But damn there are reputated companies and developers making real good games in mobile nowdays like COD: Mobile. Instead of talking about those I would like to focus on the games I used to play years back.\n Angry Birds Bad Piggies (Best game 12/10 rating, go play else I’ll hate you) Jetpack Joyride Subway Surfers  and more…you know… the good stuff. Nowadays I still play mobile games, especially Shadow Fight 3 (god-damn its good but kinda grind-y) and Rocket League Sideswipe (mobile version of rocket league) is good as well.\nClosing thoughts Well this post seems to be like a filler and I might take this down in the near future. I made this since I was bored and thought about last years ending time when the flash was to be terminated from the internet and thus making me writing this for no particular reason.\nGames are good but do not embed them into your responsibilities. Do your homework, assignments or jobs first and then play games or anything that you generally wish to do. It could be a side hustle to earn more money or something simple like a movie night. Playing games with friends is far more effective when it comes to having fun and mort importantly it perfectly fine to play games in easy mode.\nAnyways when the next semester starts for me and anything seems interesting to write here I’ll make sure to do so. See you guys later.\nGame Tags/ID Here I’ll add or update my ID so you can send me a friend request later:\n Epic Games: Zenith Fall Steam : 1117064128 (Friend code | (real)name: Zenith_Fall)  ","wordCount":"1087","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-12-29T12:38:29+05:30","dateModified":"2021-12-29T12:38:29+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ZenithFall | Ryan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ryan-orlando.github.io/posts/digital_journey/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ZenithFall-Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ryan-orlando.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script>
